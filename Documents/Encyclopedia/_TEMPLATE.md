## Writing Guidelines

1. **Be concise** - Users want quick answers, not essays
2. **Use tables** - Quick Reference and Shortcuts should always be tables
3. **Show, don't tell** - Include screenshots, diagrams, or code examples
4. **Task-oriented** - Structure around "how do I..." questions
5. **Consistent terminology** - Use the same names as the UI

---

## File Naming

Use lowercase with hyphens: `feature-name-guide.md`

Examples:
- `animation-editor-guide.md`
- `tileset-palette-guide.md`
- `inspector-panel-guide.md`
