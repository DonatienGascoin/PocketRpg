# Play Mode Hierarchy & Inspector Support

**This plan has been merged into `igameobject-interface/implementation-plan.md`.**

Both plans modify `EditorGameObject` and `Component`, and this plan depends on `IGameObject` — so they are implemented together as a single plan.

See: [`../igameobject-interface/implementation-plan.md`](../igameobject-interface/implementation-plan.md)
